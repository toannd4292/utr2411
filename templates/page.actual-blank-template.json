Creating an Event on the UTR platform with elongated or continuously extended end dates for the purpose of reporting results from a singular event with multiple weeks or multiple separate events is not allowed. Once registration has opened, the event end date cannot be extended by more than a week.<\/li><li>The Event must have at least one on-site Organizer. The UTR Event Organizer(s) can play in their own Event(s) but cannot simultaneously act as the designated Event Official in a division he\/she is participating in for the duration of the event. It is recommended that there be one Official (Umpire, Organizer, Community Volunteer, etc.) for every four courts of play.<\/li><li>Event organizers must include the officiating standards in the event description prior to the close of registration.<\/li><li>Registration close must be at least 48 hours before the event starts. Organizers can allow late registrations at their discretion until the Event starts.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Scoring and Reporting Results<\/strong><\/h2><ul><li>Reporting of scores must be verified and accurate. UTR actively monitors all Verified events for fraudulent results, including soliciting feedback from everyone who participated in the event.<\/li><li>An Event Organizer must be designated who is responsible and accountable for all scores reported and submitted. The Event Organizer cannot be an umpire for any division in which family members are registered.<\/li><li>Results must be submitted within 48 hours of the event end date. Corrections to previously submitted scores may be submitted after this period.<\/li><li>If additional matches are arranged after players have been formally eliminated from an event (such as happens often in fall intercollegiate or interscholastic tournaments) these matches may also be submitted in the same event to receive UTR credit. Score posting for matches that are not part of the event is not permitted.<\/li><li>Organizers must report withdrawals for scheduled matches, regardless of the reason for the withdrawal.<\/li><li>Organizers must report retirements from matches in progress with the accurate score at the time of the retirement.<\/li><li>Results must reflect actual scores of games and sets from playing on court. Scores cannot be used and changed as an incentive or punishment for certain behaviors (e.g. withdrawals).<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Pickleball Scoring Specifics<\/strong><\/h2><ul><li>Scoring formats for singles and doubles will follow USAP sanctioning requirements. This is found in section 12 of the USAP Official Rulebook.<\/li><li>12.B.Tournament Scoring Options. The recommended tournament scoring option is best two of three games to 11 points, win by two points. Other options include: best three of five games to 11 points, one game to 15 or one game to 21. All formats win by two points. <\/li><li>Round robin brackets may also use one game to 11, win by two points, if the bracket has six or more teams. <\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Tennis Scoring Specifics<\/strong><\/h2><ul><li>Score format for singles must be best 2 out of 3 regular sets or 2 out of 3 FAST4 sets (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tennis.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/FAST4-Tennis-Information-Sheet.pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">FAST4-Tennis-Information-Sheet<\/span><\/a>)<\/li><li>Scoring for FAST4 must be based on actual games won. If the set reaches 3-3, a 7-point tiebreaker will be used to decide the set, and the score will be reported as 4-3.<\/li><li>Score format for doubles must be best 2 out of 3 sets, an 8 game pro-set or a regular set. Third set super tiebreak and no-ad scoring is allowed.<\/li><li>Score format for high school matches, if different from the above, can be the official scoring format of official high school matches.<\/li><li>Australian providers only: Timed matches must last for at least 30 minutes, and one of the players must reach 4 games. On the occasion of an unfinished match, players must resume play until someone reaches the four-game minimum.<\/li><li>Incorporating no-ad scoring and no sitting on changeovers is recommended in order to ensure one of the players reaches 4 games in the allotted time.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"template--19123506184512__f3cd7678-cc93-4830-b119-ee4662f32303-168426507376263996-2":{"type":"button","disabled":true,"settings":{"button_label":"Button label","button_link":"","button_style_secondary":false,"button_label_2":"","button_link_2":"","button_style_secondary_2":false}}},"block_order":["template--19123506184512__f3cd7678-cc93-4830-b119-ee4662f32303-168426507376263996-0","template--19123506184512__f3cd7678-cc93-4830-b119-ee4662f32303-168426507376263996-1","template--19123506184512__f3cd7678-cc93-4830-b119-ee4662f32303-168426507376263996-2"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"desktop_content_position":"left","content_alignment":"left","color_scheme":"new","full_width":true,"padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":20}},"e0b5b644-64a3-4c35-a90b-0f680f9beff6":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"template--19123506184512__e0b5b644-64a3-4c35-a90b-0f680f9beff6-1684265356121a5b8c-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"Image with text","heading_size":"h1"}},"template--19123506184512__e0b5b644-64a3-4c35-a90b-0f680f9beff6-1684265356121a5b8c-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Pair text with an image to focus on your chosen product, collection, or blog post.
