The UTR Pickleball Rating consists of an ageless, genderless, borderless scale from 1-10.0, updating every 24 hours. The UTPR is a tournament-only rating system for the United States on a scale from 1 to 5.5+.<\/p><p>The DUPR is a global rating system on a scale from 2.00 to 8.00.<\/p><p>Your UTR-P Rating will generally be 1.0 to 1.5 points higher than the UTPR you may be used to.<\/p><p>That's because the UTPR was on a 6-point scale, whereas UTR Pickleball Rating is on a 10-point scale.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the UTR-P Rating has several advantages over the other rating systems. One key element is that UTR-P separates self-reported scores from organized\/verified match results. This unique feature provides reliability to competitive play and helps drastically reduce sandbagging. <\/p><p>The UTR-P Rating is very stable and accurate for many reasons. It was specifically developed with doubles and even mixed doubles front of mind. Other rating systems where they struggle to be truly genderless and finding a good mixed doubles partner can’t really be in a level-based way with finding a player of equal rating. This then forces organizers to look at rankings too.<\/p><p>For UTR-P, it is simple. If you want to find a partner near your level in doubles, look for a rating around your level in doubles, male or female. The UTR-P Rating reflects how you play as a doubles unit, not how you play in a 1 vs. 1 scenario.<\/p><p>Also, the UTR-P rating has a strong and fast-growing pool of connected players which provides for a highly accurate and stable global rating. The UTR-P Rating is also more accurate than points-based ranking systems. It doesn’t matter which format the player chooses, nor the partner they play with. The UTR-P rating predicts the outcome in ALL cases.
